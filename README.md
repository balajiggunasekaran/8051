# 8051
Indoor Air Quality Sensing

This project is about building a Indoor Air Quality Sensing System using an 8051 based atmel microcontroller.

Things needed to build this project:

1. PC running windows 10
2. Atmel IDE
3. 8051 development board
4. A sensor to sense C02 levels
5. A sensor to sense particles in air
6. A software to desing PCB
7. A reference guide to 8051 instruction set
8. Tools needed to assemble the PCB
